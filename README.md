# Background Separation in Python

This project demonstrates background separation using Python with OpenCV and NumPy. It processes an image by converting it to grayscale and then applying a binary threshold to distinguish the foreground from the background. This technique is useful in various image processing applications such as object detection, segmentation, and preprocessing for machine learning models.

## Features

Grayscale Conversion: Converts the input image to grayscale for easier processing.

Thresholding: Separates the foreground and background using a fixed threshold value.

Visualization: Displays the original, grayscale, and binary mask images.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.7+

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install opencv-python numpy

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/background-separation.git
cd background-separation

### 2. Run the Script

Replace example.jpg with the path to your input image. Then execute the script:

python background_separation.py

### 3. Output

The script will display three images:

Original image

Grayscale image

Binary mask showing the separated foreground and background

##### Example Output

Here are example outputs from the script:

Original Image:


Grayscale Image:


Binary Mask:


You can use these examples to verify the expected behavior of the script.

### Code Description

Main Functions

background_separation(image_path, threshold_value=30)

Input:

image_path: Path to the input image.

threshold_value: Threshold value for background separation (default: 30).

Output:

Tuple containing the original image, grayscale image, and binary mask.

Description:
This function reads the image, converts it to grayscale, and applies a binary threshold to create a mask separating the background and foreground.

display_images(original, grayscale, binary_mask)

Input:

original: Original image.

grayscale: Grayscale image.

binary_mask: Binary mask separating background and foreground.

Description:
Displays the three images (original, grayscale, and binary mask) in separate windows.

Example Usage

The script includes an example usage in the if __name__ == "__main__" block:

Reads an image from example.jpg.

Calls background_separation with a threshold value of 50.

Displays the results using display_images.

Customization

Threshold Value: Adjust the threshold_value parameter in the background_separation function to fine-tune the separation based on the input image.

Image Path: Replace example.jpg with the path to your own image.
